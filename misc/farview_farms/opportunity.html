The views are private, verdant and pastoral            - fields and forest, flora and fauna, big skies, peace on a piece            of earth. Our 51 acres is surrounded by about 800 acres of old growth            woods, so very private &ndash; however just &frac12; mile to exit            41 on I-196. This translates to less than 5 minutes to Saugatuck,            10 minutes to Holland, 40 minutes to downtown Grand Rapids, with            Chicago and Detroit less than three hours away. <em>Location, location,            location!</em><br>                  <br>      Long wide porches on 3 sides are great spots for outdoor living, dining,      and cooking. I can personally recommend a rope swing on the south porch.      Life is very good here. The lodge has been rented out at $500 per night/$2500      per week, sleeping up to 16 guests. It is comprised of 3 levels and 3 master      suites, with a total of 2532 sf. If I had the energy to market      it, it would be great for reunions, retreats, wedding groups and such.      There is also an attached summer efficiency apartment, separate and private,      480 sf, sleeping four. This could probably be rented for $750 per week,      in season. Between the apartment and lodge is a three stall garage measuring      40' x 24' . <br>      <br>      The property is zoned Ag, with a special use permit approved and permanent      for the east 34 of those acres. The west front 17 acres, including a pond,      is mostly in pasture, with an especially good alfalfa field on the south      portion. The special use permit is<br>      for &ldquo;a private social facility with various outdoor activities, including      horse stables, horseback rides, non-alcohol related group picnicking and      social events and hiking trails.&rdquo; Additional details are available      upon request for an interested party.<br>      <br>      This property is for sale, all or part.
